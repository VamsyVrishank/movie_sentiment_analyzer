# Analyze Reviews

A new movie came up ? Should you watch or not ?
Of course you care about the reviews critics give. But what do they actually want to say might be sometimes well not understandable.Should you be going to the movie or not ?
worry not lol!

This review analyzer will take the input of the user review for a movie and tell you the percentage probability of that review being positive.

* I used the imdb movie reviews dataset which is available in *tensorflow_datasets*. 
* Training is done on a sequential, two Bidirectional LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) layers. The training time is quite large so I would recommend using google colab instead.
